# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs are imperative for creating a good end product. After all, if one creates a project that does not satisfy the user's needs, it can hardly be called successful. One can intepret these needs and implement them into a program through the user of user stories. The user is interviewed, and then their needs are represented in a story that shows what they want, the conditions that it must fulfill, and the importance of that goal. This story can then be referenced by the whole team.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs through a cycle similar to the agile philosophy. First I gather what is needed to have it be considered successfully completed, plan out what will be done, implement that, and test throughout development. Some agile processes I hope to incorporate into future development work are things like the kanban board, user stories, and responding to change quickly throughout the project's development.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member in software development depends on many things. Two of the most important qualities to me are communication and dedication. By that I mean dedication to do your to the best of your ability and communicating exceptionally well with team memebrs to make sure the status of the whole project is going well.
